# Theme : Social Welfare
## How did we get this idea?
Our team members saw that in our college campus there are many stray animals which are not looked after for by any official body. The only people
that look after them are some staff members and students. They give them food and sometimes, provide them shelter. Even after that, they live a fairly miserable life.
We thought about this and realised that there must be many college campuses like ours. Although this isn't limited to just college campuses. Hence, we decided to build a website that caters to these innocent animal's needs and give them a better life. Therefore, we are helping them to be adopted, then also helping their new owners to provide them with all the facilities which will lead to a comfortable life for these animals.
